# openDTA

Rebuild [DTALite](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/DTALite) using Modern C++. Its code base is the deeply optimized [Path4GMNS](https://github.com/jdlph/Path4GMNS) rather than the original implementation of DTALite. Our goal is to build an enterprise-grade and lightning-fast dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) system that works across platforms.
